              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

# Lance-Ray Integration

A Python library that provides seamless integration between [Ray](https://ray.io/) and [Lance](https://lancedb.github.io/lance/) for distributed columnar data processing.

## Overview

Lance-Ray combines the distributed computing capabilities of Ray with the efficient columnar storage format of Lance, enabling scalable data processing workflows with optimal performance.

## Features

- **Distributed Lance Operations**: Leverage Ray's distributed computing for Lance dataset operations
- **Seamless Data Conversion**: Easy conversion between Ray datasets and Lance datasets
- **Optimized I/O**: Efficient reading and writing of Lance datasets with Ray integration
- **Schema Validation**: Automatic schema compatibility checking between Ray and Lance
- **Flexible Filtering**: Support for complex filtering operations on distributed Lance data
- **Catalog Integration**: Support for working with Lance datasets stored in various catalog services (e.g. Hive MetaStore, Iceberg REST Catalog, Unity, Gravitino, AWS Glue, etc.)

## Installation

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/lance-ray/lance-ray.git
cd lance-ray
uv pip install -e .

# Or install with development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- Ray >= 2.40.0
- PyLance >= 0.30.0
- lance-namespace >=0.0.5
- PyArrow >= 17.0.0
- NumPy >= 2.0.0

### Optional Dependencies

By default, `pandas` is not installed with Lance-Ray.
If you want to use features that accept pandas DataFrames as input, install with:

```bash
pip install lance-ray[pandas]
```

## Quick Start

```python
import ray
from lance_ray import read_lance, write_lance

# Initialize Ray
ray.init()

# Create a Ray dataset
data = ray.data.range(1000).map(lambda row: {"id": row["id"], "value": row["id"] * 2})

# Write to Lance format
write_lance(data, "my_dataset.lance")

# Read Lance dataset back as Ray dataset
ray_dataset = read_lance("my_dataset.lance")

# Perform distributed operations
result = ray_dataset.filter(lambda row: row["value"] > 100).count()
print(f"Filtered count: {result}")
```

### Using Lance Namespace

For enterprise environments with metadata catalogs, you can use Lance Namespace integration:

```python
import ray
import lance_namespace as ln
from lance_ray import read_lance, write_lance

# Initialize Ray
ray.init()

# Connect to a metadata catalog (directory-based example)
namespace = ln.connect("dir", {"root": "/path/to/tables"})

# Create a Ray dataset
data = ray.data.range(1000).map(lambda row: {"id": row["id"], "value": row["id"] * 2})

# Write to Lance format using metadata catalog
write_lance(data, namespace=namespace, table_id=["my_table"])

# Read Lance dataset back using metadata catalog
ray_dataset = read_lance(namespace=namespace, table_id=["my_table"])

# Perform distributed operations
result = ray_dataset.filter(lambda row: row["value"] > 100).count()
print(f"Filtered count: {result}")
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

**Note:** The following example requires the optional `pandas` dependency.
Install with:
```bash
pip install lance-ray[pandas]
```

```python
import pandas as pd
import ray
from lance_ray import read_lance, write_lance

# Initialize Ray
ray.init()

# Create sample data
sample_data = {
    "user_id": range(100),
    "name": [f"User_{i}" for i in range(100)],
    "age": [20 + (i % 50) for i in range(100)],
    "score": [50.0 + (i % 100) * 0.5 for i in range(100)],
}
df = pd.DataFrame(sample_data)

# Create Ray dataset
ds = ray.data.from_pandas(df)

# Write to Lance format
write_lance(ds, "sample_dataset.lance")

# Read Lance dataset back
ds = read_lance("sample_dataset.lance")

# Perform distributed operations
filtered_ds = ds.filter(lambda row: row["age"] > 30)
print(f"Filtered count: {filtered_ds.count()}")

# Read with column selection and filtering
ds_filtered = read_lance(
    "sample_dataset.lance",
    columns=["user_id", "name", "score"],
    filter="score > 75.0"
)
print(f"Schema: {ds_filtered.schema()}")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Write with custom options
write_lance(
    ds,
    "dataset.lance",
    mode="overwrite",
    min_rows_per_file=1000,
    max_rows_per_file=50000,
    data_storage_version="stable"
)

# Read with storage options and concurrency control

    storage_options={"aws_access_key_id": "...", "aws_secret_access_key": "..."},
    concurrency=10,
    ray_remote_args={"num_cpus": 2}
)

# Using different metadata catalog backends
import lance_namespace as ln

# Directory-based namespace (for local development)
dir_namespace = ln.connect("dir", {"root": "/local/tables"})

# REST API-based namespace (for enterprise catalogs like Unity, Gravitino)
rest_namespace = ln.connect("rest", {
    "base_url": "https://catalog-api.example.com",
    "api_key": "your-api-key"
})

# Write using metadata catalog
write_lance(ds, namespace=dir_namespace, table_id=["processed_data"], mode="overwrite")

# Read using metadata catalog
ds = read_lance(namespace=dir_namespace, table_id=["processed_data"])

# Add columns using metadata catalog
from lance_ray import add_columns
import pyarrow as pa

    df = batch.to_pandas()
    df['computed'] = df['value'] * 2 + df['id']
    return pa.RecordBatch.from_pandas(df[["computed"]])

add_columns(
    namespace=dir_namespace,
    table_id=["processed_data"],
    transform=add_computed_column,
